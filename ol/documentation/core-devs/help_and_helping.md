# Summary

This is a volunteer effort driven by part time developers. All help is appreciated. This guide is for helping us, help you, to help us. :)

The first thing you need to do: determine if you are a) [trying to help](#helpers) or b) [if you need help](#need) .


### Be considerate of developers:

If you are testing code that is in active development:
- Find the developer actively working on code.
- You should be familiar with the code being worked on.
- You may not get answers quickly.
- Your issues may become outdated quickly.
- Developers may be working on higher priority items.


### How can you be most helpful when you find a bug:

- Ticket the issue on GitHub as a BUG.
- What are you trying to achieve. i.e. who you are (a developer, a user, a validator), and why this is important (this causes a network failure, I can’t develop, I can’t send a transaction on the network).
- Be explicit about what version you are on (commit).
- What commands you have executed from a clean state, so that it is reproducible (ie. Starting with `rm -rf ~/.0L`)
- What was the expected result.
- What was the outcome which was not expected.

# <a id="need"> If you require help: </a>

## If a problem affects your node operation:
Please do not ticket an item in GitHub until you know there is a bug in the code.

Here's how to ask for help constructively in the #Help Desk channel:
- Description of what you are trying to achieve.
- What version you are on (commit hash, and version tag).
- Text output of `ol health`.
- Your 0L.toml file.
- What commands you ran.
- Description of was expected.
- Screenshot of the outcome.
