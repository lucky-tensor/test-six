The stdlib payload hash for voting is: 4d71a38c80f2aea14b8f8dbd6d1b785de60baaded300020e36621322c5dd4731

### Summary
v5.0.1 is a test upgrade. The main goal is to test the upgrade procedure on Mainnet.
We take the opportunity of the test upgrade to introduce a minor change to Move framework: a patch on the behavior of TowerState for onboarding of end-users.

### Changes

##### Move Changes
  - initialization of TowerState for end-users

TowerState is initialized when a user submits a VDF proof to the system. In v5+ this is done 1) at genesis by the genesis validator set, 2) by onboaring a new validator from the account.json (which includes a VDF proof) 3) onboarding an end-user with an account.json.

There is another method of onboarding wich does not use account.json: end-user account creation from a coin transfer (which uses only the end-user authkey as input). In those cases TowerState is not initialized. So currently the user is unable to be a "miner". We want to change that behavior so that "upgrading" to be a miner is a simple operation: submitting the 0th proof.

language/diem-framework/0L/TowerState.move

  - better error message on account creation tx
When accounts are being created the transaction script was displaying a cryptic message 0x1::Role error code 0. A proper error code was added to the tx script (no changes to DiemAccount module).

Relevant source:
language/diem-framework/0L_transaction_scripts/ol_account.move

##### All Files Changed

### Rust changes
None necessary. The Move framework is backwards compatible with `diem-node` from v5.0.0
