### Summary
v5.0.2 includes bugfixes to the behavior of onboarding in edge-cases.

### Changes

##### Move Changes

##### - upgrading from end-user to validator user

Once an end-user has created an account, and has begun registering a Delay Tower, that user has the option of upgrading that account to a validator account. This was an edge case which the account creations scripts were not handling correctly. And the end-user was not able ultimately to upgrade an account. The error given was that the account already existed on chain.

This upgrade creates the appropriate checks: whether the account exists or not, and if should be upgraded.  The patches happend on both the DiemAccount.move module, as well as the ol_account.move transaction scripts. 

Verification:

Further functional tests were included in testsuite.

QA of this feature was also conducted on Rex TestNet.

##### - patch bug on TowerState genesis proof submission.
V5.0.1 introduced a bug in an edge-case of account createion. End-users that had created accounts by coin transfer and subsequently started committing a Delay Tower, were not having the proof zero checked against the account address for uniqueness.

Verification:

Functional tests were patched: language/move-lang/functional-tests/tests/0L/tower_state/state_not_initialized.move 

QA was conducted on Rex TestNet.
