### A reference implementation of a neutral replicated state machine

Join a network with a [validator node](https://github.com/OLSF/libra/wiki/Onboarding-process-for-validators), to secure a state machine.

Run a [fullnode](https://github.com/OLSF/libra/wiki/Mining-VDF-Proofs), to keep a copy of the state machine.
