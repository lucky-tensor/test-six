### A reference implementation of a neutral replicated state machine


Join a network with a [validator node](ol/documentation/validator_setup.md), to secure the state machine.

Run a [fullnode](https://github.com/OLSF/libra/wiki/Mining-VDF-Proofs), to keep a copy of the state machine.

Contribute to [discussion and issues](https://github.com/OLSF/libra/issues).
